Although our goal is for the neural networks to parse out relevant information to predict housing prices, we can aid this process by pre-emptively removing variables that we believe will not contribute to the model.

Although we will later try to fill in these missings values using K-Nearest Neighbors, this becomes more difficult if most of the data is already missing. Furthermore, it is questionable how useful a variable can be if most the data is not even there. For example, the variable \"provision_retail_space_modern_sqm\" was missing over 95% of its values. Next, we threw out variables regarding geographic information, as these were forbidden by the project specifications. Then, we tossed out variables we believed were redundant. For example, \"thermal_power_plant_raion\" is a \"yes/no\" variable that indicates if a property is near a thermal power plant. However, there also exists a variable called \"thermal_power_plant_km\" that indicates the distance in kilometers from a property to the nearest thermal power plant. Since these variables describe nearly the same thing, we felt it made little sense to keep both, so we tossed the former. Finally, we also tossed variables that had some strange values.**\n",

Therefore, we resorted to manually testing different hyperparameter combinations, adjusting and tuning the model (such as the annealing rate and termination criterion) to make sure it worked correctly. To split up the work, each person in our group tested different combinations of hyperparameters, and thus had slightly different methods of tuning the model.
